# sandbox
====================
Just a sandbox for me
====================
# GIT CHEATS
    git clone "<url>" #insert the url of your git directory
    git add "<filename>" #add the file that was created to be committed
    git commit -m "<message>" #commits to the master and take 1 args
    git commit <filename> -m "<message>" #adding an specific filename into commit, without "git adding it"
    git status #status of the current repository
    git push #pushes all of the commits to the server
